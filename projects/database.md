# Project Description
This project entails the design of a database for the business office at Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC including Planning, Conceptual, Logical and Physical elements. The database provides the solution to the business process at the office such as processing purchase orders and generating invoices. In terms of optimizing and having high integrity for the model, Process entity matrix, Transaction Analysis Forms, Composite Usage Map were incorporated. Furthermore, SQL code was written to have fast performance but sustaining high integrity at the same time. Additionally, putting indexing and clustering and triggers made the model even better to implement at the environment where it is needed.
